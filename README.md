## Development

### Start the application 

```bash
go run main.go
```

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```
After copying, the variables still need to be adjusted.

## Motivation

I wanted to build a free Privnote clone to firstly build up my Go knowledge and to build a service that can be trusted as all content is openly available on the net.
